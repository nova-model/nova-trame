# Trame Theme

This is basically a work-in-progress of what a theme for the Trame applications could look like. My high-level goals are as follows:

1. Remove the need to directly edit styles in Trame+Vuetify components while still getting consistent UIs when building Trame apps.
2. Provide components that remove the need to write boilerplate to build common UI concepts (e.g. provide a Grid component instead of having a user write VContainer -> VRow -> VCol -> MyComponent).

This should probably be its own package in some capacity, but I'm not sure where it should live at this moment.
