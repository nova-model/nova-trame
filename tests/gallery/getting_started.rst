Getting Started
===============

------------
Installation
------------

You can install nova-trame directly with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nova-trame

or with `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ by placing the following in your :code:`pyproject.toml` (you can version lock with typical `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ syntax):

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    nova-trame = "*"

-----------------------
Creating an Application
-----------------------

To create your application, you'll first need to setup an application class that inherits from :code:`nova.trame.TrameApp`. This class will provide a default layout and theme for your application.

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_theme.py
    :start-after: setup app
    :end-before: setup app complete
    :dedent:

Now you can run your application with the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/gallery/main.py
    :start-after: run app
    :end-before: run app complete
    :dedent:

If you installed via Poetry, you can run the above script with:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run python my_trame_app.py [--server] [--timeout=0]

After running this, if you point your browser to http://localhost:8080, then you should see a basic web application with our default theme and a button that says "Hello World".

The two optional arguments are passed to the Trame server. :code:`--server` will prevent Trame from opening a new browser tab on launch, and :code:`--timeout=0` will tell the server to never close due to inactivity.
